### Dataset

In this project, we have multiple dataset for us to run the experiment. The data are shown as below:

* addgene
  The database that we have scraped from addgene website. There are 1599 plasmids in this dataset. We furthur use this as a strong reference for our simulated laboratory.
* plasmid
  This is the test dataset that we are used, which is referenced from the [PlasmidMaker](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30355-y). We have 100 plasmid in the testing dataset. 
* addgenedb
  This is the BLAST database that we have created for the BLAST searching method. The addgene database refers to the BLAST db of the addgene dataset. And other subDB like SC is the subDB for one shot experiment.
